# Q3. Minimum Edge Reversals So Every Node Is Reachable

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

## Problem

There is a  **simple directed graph**  with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. The graph would form a  **tree**  if its edges were bi-directional.

You are given an integer `n` and a  **2D**  integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` represents a  **directed edge**  going from node `ui` to node `vi`.

An  **edge reversal**  changes the direction of an edge, i.e., a directed edge going from node `ui` to node `vi` becomes a directed edge going from node `vi` to node `ui`.

For every node `i` in the range `[0, n - 1]`, your task is to  **independently**  calculate the  **minimum**  number of  **edge reversals**  required so it is possible to reach any other node starting from node `i` through a  **sequence**  of  **directed edges**.

Return  *an integer array* `answer` *, where* `answer[i]` *is the*   ***minimum**  number of  **edge reversals**  required so it is possible to reach any other node starting from node  *`i`*  through a  **sequence**  of  **directed edges**.*

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[2,0],[2,1],[1,3]]
Output: [1,1,0,2]
Explanation: The image above shows the graph formed by the edges.
For node 0: after reversing the edge [2,0], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 0.
So, answer[0] = 1.
For node 1: after reversing the edge [2,1], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 1.
So, answer[1] = 1.
For node 2: it is already possible to reach any other node starting from node 2.
So, answer[2] = 0.
For node 3: after reversing the edges [1,3] and [2,1], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 3.
So, answer[3] = 2.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: n = 3, edges = [[1,2],[2,0]]
Output: [2,0,1]
Explanation: The image above shows the graph formed by the edges.
For node 0: after reversing the edges [2,0] and [1,2], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 0.
So, answer[0] = 2.
For node 1: it is already possible to reach any other node starting from node 1.
So, answer[1] = 0.
For node 2: after reversing the edge [1, 2], it is possible to reach any other node starting from node 2.
So, answer[2] = 1.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 2 <= n <= 105
- edges.length == n - 1
- edges[i].length == 2
- 0 <= ui == edges[i][0] < n
- 0 <= vi == edges[i][1] < n
- ui != vi
- The input is generated such that if the edges were bi-directional, the graph would be a tree.

```ts
function minEdgeReversals(n: number, edges: number[][]): number[] {
    const graph: [number, number][][] = Array.from(
        { length: n },
        () => []
    );

    for (const [u, v] of edges) {
        // u -> v : cost 0 when going u to v
        // v -> u : cost 1 when going v to u
        graph[u].push([v, 0]);
        graph[v].push([u, 1]);
    }

    const answer = new Array(n).fill(0);

    // Find reversals needed when starting from node 0
    function dfs1(node: number, parent: number): number {
        let count = 0;

        for (const [next, cost] of graph[node]) {
            if (next === parent) continue;

            count += cost + dfs1(next, node);
        }

        return count;
    }

    answer[0] = dfs1(0, -1);

    // Reroot from node 0 to every other node
    function dfs2(node: number, parent: number): void {
        for (const [next, cost] of graph[node]) {
            if (next === parent) continue;

            if (cost === 0) {
                // Original edge: node -> next
                answer[next] = answer[node] + 1;
            } else {
                // Original edge: next -> node
                answer[next] = answer[node] - 1;
            }

            dfs2(next, node);
        }
    }

    dfs2(0, -1);

    return answer;
}
```
