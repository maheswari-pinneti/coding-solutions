# Q2. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`, a `k`  **duplicate removal**  consists of choosing `k` adjacent and equal letters from `s` and removing them, causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.

We repeatedly make `k`  **duplicate removals**  on `s` until we no longer can.

Return  *the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made*. It is guaranteed that the answer is  **unique**.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
Output: "aa"
Explanation: 
First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
Output: "ps"

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= s.length <= 105
- 2 <= k <= 104
- s only contains lowercase English letters.

```ts
function removeDuplicates(s: string, k: number): string {
    const stack: [string, number][] = [];

    for (const char of s) {
        if (stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1][0] === char) {
            stack[stack.length - 1][1]++;

            if (stack[stack.length - 1][1] === k) {
                stack.pop();
            }
        } else {
            stack.push([char, 1]);
        }
    }

    let result = "";

    for (const [char, count] of stack) {
        result += char.repeat(count);
    }

    return result;
}
```
