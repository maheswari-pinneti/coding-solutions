# Q1. Max Consecutive Ones III

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return  *the maximum number of consecutive* `1` *'s in the array if you can flip at most*  `k` `0`'s.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
- 0 <= k <= nums.length

```ts
function longestOnes(nums: number[], k: number): number {
    let left = 0;
    let zeros = 0;
    let maxLength = 0;

    for (let right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
        if (nums[right] === 0) {
            zeros++;
        }

        while (zeros > k) {
            if (nums[left] === 0) {
                zeros--;
            }
            left++;
        }

        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
    }

    return maxLength;
}
```
